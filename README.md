# [WebPlatform](http://www.webplatform.org/) static pages

Public site at [www.webplatform.org](http://www.webplatform.org/) has some pages that aren't managed by a content management system, they are built using a static site generator.

Although this workspace is for the static content of the site, it can also be used to work on HTML and CSS markup and patterns for various projects inside WebPlatform Docs.
