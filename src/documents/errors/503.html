<h2>By the way, do you know what a 503 error is?</h2>
<p>
	Every HTTP request returns a three digit code in the beginning which communicates how
	everything went in a compact way.
	These numbers are known as HTTP status codes.
	Specifically, 503 is a code that means “Service unavailable”, i.e. the server is currently
	unavailable, usually because it is overloaded or down for maintenance.
