Hi! Welcome to WebPlatform Docsâ€™ Frontend Style guide.

Each link below shows an excerpt taken from a context in the live web site so we can work on improving CSS files without requiring to use a fully-fledged development environment, only for styling.

## Use

Each view is basically a copy of the HTML at a given moment in a context within WebPlatform.org web applications. For example, it helps us improve styling in views that would require a complete install of any required web application (e.g. WordPress, MediaWiki, etc).

If you want to improve styling in situations such as: when you edit a document, add an issue to the issue tracker, this is the place to work on it!

Ideally, each file has as less as possible set of changes. Some changes that must be done are: prevent submitting a form to the real web application, make sure the view calls only local CSS/JavaScript files, and minor changes on the links.

Links must be change to make sure they stay within the workspace or to disable them. By default all links will be disabled through a small JavaScript utilty file prevents all click events, unless the link has `.allow-link` class name. This is also this small utility that displays the bar at the top.
