  <p>
  Intel has been a sponsor of open source software projects for many years, but these projects need developer documentation to effectively exploit them. This effort in support of vendor-neutral documentation of HTML5, related specifications and technologies is very valuable, and we're pleased to support Web Platform Docs as a Steward and content contributor.
