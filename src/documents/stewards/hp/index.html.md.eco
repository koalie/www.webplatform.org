  As a founding steward of Web Platform Docs, we appreciate the importance of standards, understand the frustration of dealing with non-standard features and the challenges in practical implementation of standards into products. We see great value in enabling developers with a place they can document how web technologies work in practical terms and are pleased to be supporting this initiative by providing infrastructure on [HP Cloud](https://www.hpcloud.com/) for webplatform.org.
